[00:00.000]--- lesson 23  Bird flight 鸟的飞行方法
[00:03.709]No two sorts of birds practise quite the same sort of flight;^没有任何两种鸟的飞行方式是相同的。
[00:08.385]the varieties are infinite; but two classes may be roughly seen.^鸟的飞行方式千差万别，但大体上可分为两类。
[00:13.793]Any ship that crosses the Pacific is accompanied for many days by the smaller albatross,^任何一艘横度太平洋的轮船都会有一种小信天翁伴随飞行许多天。
[00:20.271]Which may keep company with the vessel for an hour without visible or more than occasional movement of wing.^它们随船飞行一小时也难得见其扇动一下翅膀。
[00:27.455]The currents of air that the walls of the ship direct upwards, as well as in the line of its course, are enough to give the great bird with its immense wings sufficient sustenance and progress.^沿船体上升的气流和沿航线向前的气流给这种巨翼大鸟以足够的浮力和推力。
[00:40.490]The albatross is the king of the gliders,^信天翁是滑翔飞行的鸟类之王，
[00:43.990]the class of fliers which harness the air to their purpose, but must yield to its opposition.^它能自如地驾驭空气，但必须顺气流飞行。
[00:50.704]In the contrary school, the duck is supreme.^与滑翔鸟相对的另一类鸟中，数野鸭本领最高。
[00:54.936]It comes nearer to the engines with which man has 'conquered' the air, as he boasts.^它更近乎于人类自夸“征服”了空气的发动机。
[01:00.630]Duck, and like them the pigeons, are endowed with steel-like muscles,^野鸭及它们相似的鸽子有天赋的钢铁般的肌肉，
[01:06.377]that are a good part of the weight of the bird,^占了体重的很大一部分。
[01:09.433]and these will ply the short wings with such irresistible power that they can bore for long distances through an opposing gale before exhaustion follows.^这些肌肉以巨大的力量扇动短小的翅膀，使这类鸟能顶着大风飞行很远的路程才会疲劳。
[01:20.666]Their humbler followers, such as partridges, have a like power of strong propulsion, but soon tire.^次于野鸭和鸽子的鸟，如鹧鸪，有相似的巨大推动力，但很快会疲劳。
[01:28.529]You may pick them up in utter exhaustion, if wind over the sea has driven them to a long journey.^如果海风驱使它们飞行很长距离，你可捡到一些因筋疲力尽而摔下来的鹧鸪。
[01:35.504]The swallow shares the virtues of both schools in highest measure.^燕子充分兼有这两类鸟的长处，
[01:39.788]It tires not, nor does it boast of its power;^它既不疲劳，也不炫耀自己的飞翔力；
[01:43.784]but belongs to the air, travelling it may be six thousand miles to and from its northern nesting home, feeding its flown young as it flies,^在空中十分自如，可以飞行6,000英里，可以飞往北方做窝的老家，再从老家飞回；一边飞一边喂养会飞的雏燕，
[01:54.573]and slipping through a medium that seems to help its passage even when the wind is adverse. such birds do us good, though we no longer take omens from their flight on this side and that;^甚至在顶风时也能在气流中滑翔，似乎气流在帮它前进。这些鸟对我们是有益的，虽然我们不再从它们的飞翔姿态来占卜吉凶，
[02:07.974]and even the most superstitious villagers no longer take off their hats to the magpie and wish it good-morning.^连最迷信的村民也不再对喜鹊脱帽行礼，祝它早安了。

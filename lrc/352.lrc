[00:11.990]Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green,^尽管那只瓶子呈淡绿色，
[00:16.431]an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, greyish substance.^但细心的客人很快就会发现瓶里装的是一种看上去黏稠，颜色发灰的东西。

[02:15.784]When the woman shook her head in bewilderment,^那个女售货员还是迷惑不解地摇了摇头。

[02:28.506]This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf.^他的解释显然对女售货员有些启示。她一个货架接着一个货架地寻找，
[02:35.089]She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements.^拿出各种各样稀奇古怪的化妆品，但没有一样能够符合哈里的要求。

[02:59.984]However, it was his turn to be surprised,^没料到这回该轮到他自己吃惊了。

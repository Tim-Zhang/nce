[00:00.000]--- lesson 35  Justice was done 伸张正义
[00:04.545]The word justice is usually associated with courts of law.^“正义”这个词常常是同法庭连在一起的。
[00:10.292]We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt.^当某人被证据确凿地证明无罪或有罪的时候，我们也许会说正义得到了伸张。
[00:17.894]Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law.^正义是复杂的法律机器的组成部分。
[00:22.465]Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it.^那些寻求正义的人走的是一条崎岖的道路，从来没有把握他们最终将找到正义。

[00:35.866]There are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept.^在个别情况下，正义不再是一种抽象概念。
[00:42.736]Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference.^奖惩的实施是不受人的意志支配的。
[00:49.110]At such times, justice acts like a living force.^在这种时候，正义像一种有生命的力量行使其职能。
[00:54.152]When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right',^当我们说“他罪有应得”这句话的时候，
[00:58.384]we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.^我们部分地承认了某种特定的环境使得正义自动地起了作用。
[01:08.023]When a thief was caught on the premises of a large jewellery store one morning,^一天上午，当一个小偷在一家大型珠宝店里被人抓住的时候，
[01:13.900]the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right.'^店员一定会忍不住说：“他罪有应得。”
[01:21.816]The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys.^那是一座老式的、经过改造的房子，店里有许多废置不用的大壁炉和又高又窄的烟囱。
[01:30.227]Towards midday, a girl heard a muffled cry coming from behind one of the walls.^快到中午的时候，一个女售货员听见从一堵墙里传出一种闷声闷气的叫声。
[01:37.149]As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade.^由于这种喊叫声重复了几次，她跑去报告经理，经理当即给消防队挂了电话。
[01:45.352]The cry had certainly come from one of the chimneys,^喊叫声肯定是从烟囱里传出来的，
[01:49.009]but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was.^然而，因为烟囱太多，消防队员无法确定到底是哪一个。
[01:56.193]They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries.^他们通过叩击烟囱倾听那人的喊叫声而确定了传出声音的那个烟囱。
[02:03.533]After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney.^他们凿透了18英寸厚的墙壁，发现有个人卡在烟囱里。
[02:12.310]As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move,^由于烟囱太窄，那人无法动弹。
[02:17.091]but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall.^消防队员在墙上挖了个大洞，才终于把他解救出来。
[02:24.509]The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney.^那个看起来满脸沮丧、浑身漆黑的家伙从烟囱里一出来，就承认头天夜里他企图到店里行窃，但让烟囱卡住了。

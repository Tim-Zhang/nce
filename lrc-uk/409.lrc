[00:00.000]--- lesson 9  Royal espionage 王室谍报活动
[00:04.493]Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a minstrel.^阿尔弗雷德大帝曾亲自充当间谍。他扮作吟游歌手到丹麦军队的营地里侦察。
[00:12.147]In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere.^当时，浪迹天涯的吟游歌手到处受到欢迎，
[00:16.614]They were not fighting men, and their harp was their passport.^他们不是作战人员，竖琴就是他们的通行证。
[00:21.211]Alfred had learned many of their ballads in his youth, and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring.^阿尔弗德年轻时学过许多民歌，并能穿插演一些杂技和小魔术使自己的节目多样化。
[00:30.171]While Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to penetrate the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders.^当阿尔弗雷德人数不多的军队开始在阿塞尔纳慢慢集结时，他亲自潜入丹麦入侵司令官古瑟罗姆的营地。
[00:42.501]There had settled down for the winter at Chippenham: thither Alfred went.^丹麦军已在切本哈姆扎下营准备过冬，阿尔弗雷德便来到此地。
[00:48.509]He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of conquerors, and their security precautions were casual.^他马上发现丹麦军纪律松弛，他们以征服者自居，安全措施马马虎虎。
[00:58.593]They lived well, on the proceeds of raids on neighbouring regions.^他们靠掠夺附近的地区的财物过着舒适的生活。
[01:03.060]There they collected women as well as food and drink, and a life of ease had made them soft.^他们不仅搜刮吃的喝的，而且抢掠妇女，安逸的生活已使丹麦军队变得软弱无力。
[01:09.851]Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney.^阿尔弗雷德在敌营呆了一个星期后，回到了阿塞尔纳。
[01:14.553]The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde.^他集结在那里的军队和丹麦大军相比是微不足道的，
[01:19.099]But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle:^然而，阿尔弗雷德断定，丹麦人已不再适应持久的战争，
[01:24.584]and that their commissariat had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.^他们的军需供应处于无组织状态，只是靠临时抢夺来维持。
[01:31.193]So, faced with the Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle but harried the enemy.^因此，面对丹麦人的进攻，阿尔弗雷德没有贸然同敌人作战，而是采用骚扰敌人的战术。
[01:38.873]He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him.^他的部队不停地移动，牵着敌人的鼻子，让他们跟着他跑。
[01:43.184]His patrols halted the raiding parties: hunger assailed the Danish army.^他派出巡逻队阻止敌人抢劫，因而饥饿威胁着丹麦军队。
[01:49.061]Now Alfred began a long series of skirmishes -- and within a month the Danes had surrendered.^这时，阿尔弗雷德发起一连串小规模的进攻，结果不出一个月，丹麦人就投降了。
[01:56.454]The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of royal espionage!^这一幕历史可以说是王室谍报活动中最精彩的篇章。.

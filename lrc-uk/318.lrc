[00:23.440]The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is mistaken.^那种认为现代艺术只能在博物馆里才能看到的观点是错误的。
[00:29.760]Even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places.^即使是对艺术不感兴趣的人也不会不注意到在公共场所展示的现代艺术品。
[00:39.480]Strange forms stand in gardens, and outside buildings and shops.^公园里、大楼和商店外竖立着的奇形怪状的雕塑，

[00:47.960]Some so-called 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.^有些所谓的“现代”艺术品在那里已经陈列了近80年了。
[00:54.160]In spite of this, some people -- including myself -- were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture.^尽管如此，最近举办的一次现代雕塑展览还是使一些人（包括我在内）大吃了一惊。

[01:42.280]In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights.^展厅中央是装有彩色灯泡的许多高高的构件，灯泡一刻不停地闪烁着，就像失去了控制的红绿灯。

[02:12.040]but to give them electric shocks as well!^而且还想给人以电击似的！
